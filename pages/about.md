# About Me

{% image="projects/proj-1/Headshot.jpg" %}

I was born and raised in the St. Louis area and completed my Bachelor's of Science in Economics in May of 2023. Post-grad, I was accepted and enrolled into the Master's of Urban Spatial Analytics program at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. This portfolio is a collection of my projects from previous coursework, contributions during my internship at the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, as well as various personal projects.
