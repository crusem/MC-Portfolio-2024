# About Me

I was born and raised in the St. Louis area and received my Bachelor's of Science in Economics with High Distinction in May of 2023 from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. During my time at the University of Nebraska, I worked as a research assistant for the African Poetry Book Distribution Project, community outreach intern at AARP, and a grading and learning assistant for advanced economics courses such as labor economics and intermediate microeconomics. Additionally, I was involved in my campus community as a campus tour guide, resident assistant, and peer mentor.

Post-grad, I was accepted and enrolled into the Master's of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) program at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. During my first semester in the MUSA program, I completed courses related to statistics, spatial analytics, and machine learning while working as a Transportation Intern at the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.

This portfolio is a collection of my projects and assignments, contributions during my internship at the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and various personal projects.
