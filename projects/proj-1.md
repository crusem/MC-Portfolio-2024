## Project Overview & Objective
This project was submited by Marissa Cruse and Alyssa Felix-Arreola during the 2023 Fall semester for Public Policy Analytics at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The City of Cincinnati has a dataset of heroin overdose locations. Using data extracted from the Cincinnati, Ohio's Open Data portal, our job was to estimate a geospatial risk prediction model, predicting overdoses as a function of environmental factors.

The objective of this projec was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of risk factors that increase the likelihood of the occurence of overdose.
