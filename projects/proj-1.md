## Predict Heroin Overdose Occurrence to Allocate Prevention Resources in Cincinnati, Ohio
This project was submitted by Marissa Cruse and Alyssa Felix-Arreola during the 2023 Fall semester for Public Policy Analytics at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of environmental risk factors to predict risk of overdose occurence in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to predicting risk of overdose, this model can serve as a sighting mechanism for harm reduction resources in Cincinnati, Ohio.
