## Machine Learning and Resource Allocation
### Public Policy Analytics Final- [Predict Heroin Overdose Events to Better Allocate Prevention Resources](https://crusem.github.io/MC-Portfolio-2024/PPAFinal.html){:target="_blank"}
Assignment Prompt: *"The City of Cincinnati, OH has a dataset of heroin overdose locations. Using these data extracted from the city’s Open Data portalLinks to an external site., your job will be to estimate a geospatial risk prediction model, predicting overdoses as a function of environmental factors like crime, 311 and inspections. You should validate your model against a kernel density, as we have did in class. Also, you should try to train your model from one time period (long enough to have enough data) and test it on an out of out of sample test set time period (the following year, for instance). Note the fact that the data have some accuracy diminished to make them more anonymous – think about how this plays into your prediction and use case."*
