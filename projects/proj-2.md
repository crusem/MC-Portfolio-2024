## Using a Geospatial Prediction Model to Predict Asthma Prevalance by Census Tract in Philadelphia, PA
This project was submited by Marissa Cruse and Alyssa Felix-Arreola during the 2023 Fall semester for Geospatial Data Science in Python at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The objective of this project was to build a machine learning algorithm based off of environmental risk factors to predict asthma prevalance by census tract in Philadelphia. We validated this model against the Center for Disease Control's asthma prevalance estimate.
