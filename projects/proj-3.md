## Capstone Project Spring 2024
For my Master's capstone, I am developing a web application that tells users where their favorite artists are from!

The goal of this project is to investigate whether spatial clusters emerge in music streaming patterns based on the geographic origin of artists. By testing for spatial autocorrelation, we aim to identify potential clusters within the music industry's streaming data. This exploration offers an opportunity to observe how music shapes cities and communities. Furthermore, the envisioned web application, serving as the foundation of this exploration, aims to enhance users' understanding of the cultural significance embedded within music.

I created this page on my portfolio to keep track of my progress in developing my capstone project.
